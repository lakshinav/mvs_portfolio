# Is it possible to break the «curse of dimensionality»? Spatial specifications of multivariate volatility models

Code for the paper in [Applied Econometrics](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/risapltrx/0249.htm) journal, 2014.

The article is devoted to the estimation of multivariate volatility of a portfolio consisted from twenty American stocks. 
The six specifications of multivariate volatility models are formulated and estimated. 
It’s demonstrated that spatial specifications of multivariate volatility models allow not only reduce the dimension of the problem, but in some cases outdo original specifications at in-sample and out-of-sample comparison.
